\chapter*{Preface}
\label{cha:preface}
This thesis is a research and development effort to accomplish data intensive operations in a distributed manner with a 
collective but decentralized approach toward workflow management and to minimize data transfer during such operations.

This work has not been an implementation task nor a purely theoretical work. 
It means that I was not supposed to create an application or develop a software from ground up (even though eventually I did), instead
I have been responsible to study about and define the problem of my client and assist them either with 
finding a suitable solution and helping them to integrate it into their development process or propose a new approach to address their 
needs. My activities include but not limited to analyzing the problem, collecting requirements,
studying state of the art software frameworks and related products,
analyzing them against the defined requirements, proposing a solution and developing a prototype.

During this thesis an open source prototype application has been developed which is available
online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mehdisadeghi/konsensus}}. The source files
of the current document are also available online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mehdisadeghi/cme-thesis}}.
