\chapter{Requirements}
\label{cha:requirements}

Every group has its own needs. That is the reason that we have many different solutions in the market.
In this chapter we explain the requirements according to our context.

\section{Data Location Abstraction}
We need to abstract the absolute path of required data from users. To run every operation
we provide certain data files as input. This is part of the manual step of running an operation and
it makes it fragile. Currently users have to take care of storing input files in correct folders before
running their scripts, or they have to copy the input files from the shared network file system to the
appropriate runtime folder. This is something that we want to disappear. We want the system to 
manage the input data and its absolute location.

\section{Server Agnostic}
We want to have the same user experience regardless of the machine that we connect to. It is very common
that a user moves from one workstation to another one or connects to different machines using SSH. We 
want to be able to provide the requested information to the user, no matter to which machine she connects.

We could have any number of active computers in our network which are running an instance of our program
and we want to let the users to talk to each of them and be able to launch same operations and get the same result.

It also means that if one users initiates an operation in first computer and then goes to the next one and asks
for the status of the operation, she should be able to do that as if she is working with the first computer.

\section{Distributed}
We need a distributed solution which eliminates the need to have central orchestrator.
We want to decrease the dependency between running programs therefore we want to have 
some sort of distributed application which distributes the operations to all other computers.

\section{Distributing Data}
We want to be able to store the result of an operation on different computers, i.e. distribute it on the network.

\section{Runtime Control}
While an operation is running we want to have full control over every step. In traditional approaches using job
scheduling systems this is not possible. Except basic control such as stop, resume or similar operations, users
can not control the runtime behavior of their program. In contrast we want to control all aspects of an operation.

\section{Easy Deployment}
We look for a solution that is easy to deploy onto new machines. A fully automated installation process
is required.

We need a distributed solution.
Easily deployable.
User space solution
Light weight



\section{Assumptions}
During this work we have a number of assumptions. We have a certain problem which we want to focus
on rather than reintroducing solutions that already exist. For this reason we discuss regarding our 
needs.

\subsection{Collaborating Network}
We assume there is a network of computers which are available to run the tasks, each node is running an instance
of the application. We will propose our collaboration and data transfer algorithm between them later.

\subsection{Data Characteristics}
We need to discuss more about the data. In our scientific context data is mostly numerical and explains characteristics
of physical particles such as atoms and molecules. These data is being used to simulate collections of particles called
models. Although our work is not dependent on these, they help us to understand the definition of the data that
we often refer to in this report. One important aspect of the data that we are interested in is that it is not critical 
and we can reproduce it. 

\subsection{Data Transfer}
We assume a data transfer approach is already in place. This could be any file system which supports 
network storage. Rather than going into details of how data could be transferred more efficiently, we will
focus on finding which data to be transferred and from which computer to which destination.

\subsection{Workflow}
In contrast to data we are interested in workflow. We want to find a reliable approach to access and update 
state of our workflow on any arbitrary node which is part of our collaborative network.
